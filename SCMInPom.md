The `<scm>` element in a **Maven `pom.xml`** file is used to specify the **Source Code Management (SCM)** information for the project. This section typically provides information about the version control system (like Git, Subversion, etc.) that is used to manage the source code for the project.

### Key Points of `<scm>` Element:
- **SCM** stands for **Source Code Management**, which refers to systems like Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc.
- The `<scm>` element contains information such as the repository URL, connection details, and the type of SCM used.
- It's useful for linking the project to its repository, making it easy for others (and tools like Jenkins) to access and interact with the repository.
  
### Common Usage:
Here’s an example of how you might define SCM details in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<scm>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:ssh://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git</developerConnection>
    <url>https://github.com/youruser/yourproject</url>
    <tag>HEAD</tag>
</scm>
```

### Explanation of the Tags:
1. **`<connection>`**:
   - Specifies the URL used to connect to the SCM repository. This is typically used by Maven to fetch information about the repository.
   - The connection URL can be in different formats, such as `git`, `svn`, etc.
   - For example: `scm:git:git://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git`.

2. **`<developerConnection>`**:
   - Specifies the URL used for **developer operations**, like pushing changes to the repository. This is typically an SSH or other secure connection.
   - This is used for operations like `mvn release:prepare` and `mvn release:perform`.

3. **`<url>`**:
   - Specifies the web URL where the repository is hosted. This URL can point to the web-based interface for your version control system (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab).
   - For example: `https://github.com/youruser/yourproject`.

4. **`<tag>`**:
   - Specifies the version or tag that is being used in the SCM repository. Usually, this is set to `HEAD` to represent the latest version, but it can be changed to a specific version or tag if needed.

### Example with GitHub:

```xml
<scm>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git</connection>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:ssh://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git</developerConnection>
    <url>https://github.com/youruser/yourproject</url>
    <tag>HEAD</tag>
</scm>
```

In this example:
- The `connection` is the URL used for fetching the project from the Git repository.
- The `developerConnection` is a secure SSH URL used by developers to push changes to the repository.
- The `url` is the public URL for the repository on GitHub.
- The `tag` indicates that the `HEAD` (latest commit) should be used.

### Benefits of Including `<scm>` in `pom.xml`:
- **Maven Releases**: Tools like the Maven Release Plugin can use the SCM information to interact with the repository (e.g., tagging the repository with the release version).
- **Project Metadata**: Provides helpful metadata for other developers or CI/CD tools (like Jenkins) to easily fetch the project’s source code from the repository.
- **Easy Access**: It makes it easier for contributors to find the project repository directly from the `pom.xml`.

### Example `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>example-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>

    <!-- SCM Section -->
    <scm>
        <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git</connection>
        <developerConnection>scm:git:ssh://github.com/youruser/yourproject.git</developerConnection>
        <url>https://github.com/youruser/yourproject</url>
        <tag>HEAD</tag>
    </scm>

    <!-- Other Configuration -->
</project>
```

### Conclusion:
The `<scm>` element is important in Maven projects because it links the project to its source code repository. This information is used by Maven tools and other developers to interact with the project's codebase. You should include it when working with version control systems like Git, SVN, etc.
